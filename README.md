# Deadline  
*Meet the quota or meet your end.*

**Deadline** is a sci-fi action roguelike where you play as a mid-level corporate grunt working for **Xenocorp Industries**â€”a ruthless, galaxy-spanning conglomerate contracted to "normalize" alien populations for resource extraction. You're not here to ask questions. You're here to hit your **daily kill quota**â€”before your shipâ€™s dwindling **power cells** run dry.

## ðŸ§  Core Mechanics

- **Harvest Souls**: Collect alien souls to fulfill your quota and use them as currency.
- **Energy System**: Your shipâ€™s **power** steadily drains over time, and faster depending on the weapons and turrets you have equipped. When power reaches zero, the mission **ends immediately**â€”regardless of your progress.
- **The Shop**: Between missions, spend souls on:
  - New **weapons** *(up to 8 slots)*
  - Deployable **turrets** *(up to 4 slots)*
  - **Stat upgrades**
  - The **GIGA DRILL** â€“ a unique weapon that devours an entire slot.
- **Procedural World Map**: Every mission takes place on a randomly generated alien planet.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: Each completed mission raises the stakes:
  - Tougher enemies
  - Higher quotas
  - Inflated shop prices
